<h1>JavaScrypt: Browser-Based Cryptography Tools</h1>

<hr class="h" />

<p>
Welcome to JavaScrypt, the high-security data encryption
solution which runs entirely in your Web browser.
To use the page, your browser must support
JavaScript and you must not have disabled execution of that
language.  Let's see&hellip;
</p>

<form action="#" onsubmit="return false;">
<p class="c">
<input type="text" name="warning_field" id="warning"
    style="background-color: #FFA0A0; color: #000000;"
    value="No go!  Your browser does not support JavaScript or it is disabled."
    size="70" class="c" readonly="readonly" />
</p>
</form>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
    //  Clear out "sorry, no JavaScript" message from text box.
    document.getElementById("warning").value = "Your browser supports JavaScript" +
        "\u2014you can use these programs.";
    document.getElementById("warning").style.backgroundColor = "#00FF00";
// -->
</script>

<p>
If the box above says &ldquo;Your browser supports
JavaScript&rdquo;, you're in business.
</p>

<p>
JavaScrypt runs <em>entirely in your browser</em>&mdash;nothing
is sent to any Web site when you use it.  You can, if you wish,
<a href="javascrypt.zip">download JavaScrypt</a>
to your own computer and use it when not connected
to the Internet.
</p>

<p>
JavaScrypt's encryption facilities use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"
    rel="Target:JavascryptAux">Advanced
Encryption Standard</a> (AES) adopted by the United States as
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf"
    rel="Target:JavascryptAux">Federal
Information Processing Standard 197</a>.  AES supports key lengths of
128, 192, and 256 bits; JavaScrypt uses 256 bit keys exclusively.
</p>

<p>
If you're already familiar with encryption, proceed directly to the pages which
implement the various components of JavaScrypt.  If you're a newcomer,
you may prefer to work through the
<a href="example.html">JavaScrypt Tutorial</a>, which demonstrates
how they're used.

<h2><a id="why">Why Encrypt with JavaScript?</a></h2>

<p>
At first glance, JavaScript may seem an odd choice for
implementing encryption.  These programs are rather
large and complicated, and downloading and running them them
takes longer than would be required for a Java applet or to
access a CGI program on a Web server.  I chose JavaScript for
two reasons: <em>security</em> and <em>transparency</em>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security.</b> &nbsp;
The sole reason for encryption is to protect privacy.  This
means the process cannot involve any link whose security is
suspect.  If messages were encrypted by a Web server, they
would have to pass over the Internet, where any intermediate
site might intercept them.  Even if some mechanism such as
secure HTTP could absolutely prevent the data's being
intercepted, you'd still have no way to be sure the site which
performed the encryption didn't keep a copy in a file,
conveniently tagged with your Internet address.
</p>

<p>
In order to have any degree of security, it is essential
that all processing be done on <em>your</em> computer, without
involving any transmission or interaction with other
sites on the Internet.  A Web browser with JavaScript makes
this possible, since the programs embedded in these
pages run entirely on your own computer and do not
transmit anything over the Internet.  Output appears
only in text boxes, allowing you to cut and paste it
to another application.  From there on, security is
up to you.
</p>

<p>
Security is never absolute.  Data encrypted with these pages
might be compromised in a variety of ways, including but not
limited to the following:
</p>

<ul class="pspace">
<li>    Your Web browser and/or JavaScript interpreter may
        contain bugs or deliberate security violations
        which report activity on your computer back to some
        other Internet site.</li>

<li>    Some other applet running on another page in your
        browser, perhaps without your being aware of its
        existence, is spying on other windows.</li>

<li>    Some other &ldquo;spyware&rdquo; application running on
        your computer may have compromised your system's
        security and be snooping on your activity.</li>

<li>    Your Web browser may be keeping a &ldquo;history
        log&rdquo; or &ldquo;cache&rdquo; of data you generate.
        Somebody may come along later and recover a copy of your
        data from that log.</li>

<li>    The implementation of these pages may contain a bug
        or deliberate error which makes its results
        insecure.  This is why <a href="#trans"><cite>transparency</cite></a>,
        discussed below, is essential.</li>

<li>    Your computer's security may have been compromised
        physically; when's the last time you checked that a
        bug that transmits your keystrokes and/or screen
        contents to that white van parked down the street
        wasn't lurking inside your computer cabinet?</li>
</ul>

<p>
One can whip oneself into a fine fever of paranoia worrying about
things like this.  One way to rule out the most probable risks
is to <a href="javascrypt.zip">download</a>
a copy of these pages and the JavaScript programs they reference
and run it from a &ldquo;<tt><b>file:</b></tt>&rdquo; URL on a
computer with no network connection whatsoever located in secure
premises under your control.  And look very carefully at any
files created by your Web browser.  You may find the most
interesting things squirreled away there&hellip;.
</p>

<p>
<b><a id="trans">Transparency</a>.</b> &nbsp;
Any security-related tool is only as good as its design and
implementation.  <em>Transparency</em> means that, in essence,
all the moving parts are visible so you can judge for yourself
whether the tool merits your confidence.  In the case of a
program, this means that complete source code must be
available, and that you can verify that the program you're
running corresponds to the source code provided.
</p>

<p>
The very nature of JavaScript achieves this transparency. The
programs are embedded into the Web pages you interact with; to
examine them you need only use your browser's &ldquo;View
Source&rdquo; facility, or save the page into a file on your
computer and read it with a text editor; any JavaScript
components the pages reference can be similarly downloaded and
examined in source code form.  JavaScript's being an interpreted
language eliminates the risk of your running a program different
from the purported source code: with an interpreted language
what you read is what you run.
</p>

<p>
Transparency is important even if you don't know enough about
programming or security to determine whether the programs
contain any flaws.  The very fact that they can be examined
by anybody allows those with the required expertise to pass
judgment, and you can form your own conclusions based on
their analysis.
</p>

modified slightly for use in JavaScrypt but produces output
identical to the reference implementation.
