# JavaScrypt — Browser-Based Cryptography Tools

JavaScrypt is collection of Web pages and programs in the JavaScript 
language perform military-grade encryption (256 bit secret key AES) 
entirely within your Web browser—you needn't download nor install any 
software, and nothing is sent to any Web site when you encrypt or 
decrypt a message.  You can download the page source and JavaScript 
programs to your own computer and use them even when not connected to 
the Internet.  Companion pages provide a text-based steganography 
facility and key generator suitable for preparing one-time key lists.

This repository is the development directory and archive for
Fourmilab's Web resource, “[*JavaScrypt*:
Browser-Based Cryptography Tools](https://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/)”.
All of the utilities may be run directly from those pages or
downloaded to run locally on your own computer.  The master copies of
the Web pages, development tools and resources, and change log is
maintained in this repository.

## Structure of the repository

This repository is organised into the following directories.

* **webtree**: Replica of the Web tree from the Fourmilab site
containing all of the HTML documents, images, and downloads.  These 
pages contain relative references to style sheets, icons, and other 
resources on the Fourmilab Web site and will not display properly 
without modification in other environments.

* **build**: Source code from which the Web tree and downloads are
built, including tools to compress the original source files to
the “lean” version for offline use.
