<h1>JavaScrypt Development Log</h1>

<hr class="h" />

<p />

<h3>2003 September 24</h3>

<p>
Modified <tt>formatPlaintext</tt> in <tt>aes.js</tt> to fill
plaintext buffers that aren't an even number of 32 byte AES
blocks with pseudorandom bytes from <tt>getRandomBytes</tt>
rather than zeroes.
</p>

<p>
Extracted the JavaScript code embedded in <tt>index.html</tt>
into a new <tt>jscrypt.js</tt> module.  This will make it easier
to programmatically assemble the &ldquo;lean&rdquo; version from
the main file.
</p>

<p>
Updated the <tt>Makefile</tt> to explicitly list the JavaScript
modules included in the archive as opposed to including them with
a wildcard specification.  This permits keeping the compressed
JavaScript files for the lean version in the same directory without
having them included in the archive.
</p>

<p>
Added mark-up to <tt>index.html</tt> to denote those parts to be
dropped when assembling the lean version.
</p>

<h3>2003 September 25</h3>

<p>
For some reason, on Mozilla 1.3/Linux, the &ldquo;Key&rdquo;
edit line displayed in a larger Courier font in the lean version
(but not the full version, which has no changes whatsoever which
should affect the style of this box).  I removed
&ldquo;Courier&rdquo; from the <tt>font-family</tt> and left it
as &ldquo;monospace&rdquo;, which appears to work everywhere.
No other browser had any problem with Courier as an alternative
to monospace.
</p>

<h3>2003 September 27</h3>

<p>
Added the three ECB test cases from the NIST standard test set to
the <tt>test.html</tt> testbed.  Each button plugs the key, plaintext,
and ciphertext for the test in the corresponding boxes; you may then
encrypt and decrypt to verify nothing changes.  Key size and block
size are now sensed automatically based on the length of the hexadecimal
value in the field.
</p>

<h3>2003 September 28</h3>

<p>
Integrated the <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> and <tt>stego.html</tt> pages
along with their supporting <tt>wordtab.js</tt> and <tt>stegodict.js</tt>
files.  Added these files to the appropriate places in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Added the ability to suppress the generation of headers and trailers in
Base64 armour by setting <tt>base64addsent</tt> to <tt>false</tt> before
calling <tt>armour_base64</tt> in <tt>armour.js</tt>.  This permits
Stego to optionally suppress headers when it's being used to steganify
a Base64 file belonging to another application.
</p>

<h3>2003 September 29</h3>

<p>
Added user-defined seed specification to <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt>.  If
a pseudorandom seed is requested, its value is displayed in the
user-defined seed field so it may be saved for subsequent use.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 15</h3>

<p>
Extracted the entropy collection logic from
<tt>javascrypt.html</tt> and <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> into a
new <tt>entropy.js</tt> module. Added a new
<tt>mouseMotionEntropy</tt> function which captures mouse motion
events and collects a specified number of subsequent triples of
screen X and Y co-ordinates (we use the absolute screen position
as it is more entropic than position within the client window),
and the time of the mouse movement.  This primes the entropy
array with reasonably high quality data before most operations
which require it.
</p>

<p>
Modified <tt>jscrypt.js</tt> to use <tt>AESprng</tt> in
<tt>aesprng.js</tt> to generate the initial vector for CBC
encryption and pad to an even number of blocks (if required).
The AES-based pseudorandom generator is primed with a seed
computed from the entropy vector.
</p>

<p>
Updated <tt>aesprng_test.html</tt> to conform with the changes to initial
vector generation.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 17</h3>

<p>
Increased the maximum length of the key in <tt>javascrypt.html</tt>
and the seed in <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> to 1024 characters.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 18</h3>

<p>
Replaced <tt>"./"</tt> link targets in references to the JavaScrypt
home page with <tt>"index.html"</tt> so these links work correctly
when referencing the pages from a <tt>file:</tt> URL on a machine
to which the user has downloaded the pages.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 19</h3>

<p>
Modified <tt>aesprng_test.html</tt> to generate hexadecimal
pseudorandom streams suitable for testing with
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/">ENT</a>, and
rewrote the code which assembles the strings and stuffs them into
the results dialogue box to run about a thousand times
faster, avoiding JavaScript's (at least on Mozilla)
exponential slowdown when appending large results to
<tt>textarea</tt> value fields.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 20</h3>

<p>
Further cleaned up <tt>aesprng_test.html</tt> so it's
comprehensible without reading the source code.  It now lets you
specify the number of bytes to be generated and whether they're
generated with the <tt>next</tt> or <tt>nextInt</tt> methods
with HTML controls, shows the number of bytes when generated if
the script is paused by an &ldquo;unresponsive&rdquo; warning,
and lets you generate seeds just like <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt>
does.  I also cleaned up the format of the output it generates
so it look just like an &ldquo;XD&rdquo; output and no longer
requires the &ldquo;<tt>-s</tt>&rdquo; option when converting to
binary with XD. The <tt>aesprng_test.html</tt> being
sufficiently civilised now, I included it in the source
distribution.
</p>

<p>
Added comments to the methods in <tt>aesprng.js</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Added missing <tt>example.html</tt> description to
<tt>distribution.html</tt>.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 21</h3>

<p>
Fixed truncation of warning message in <tt>index.html</tt>
if JavaScript is not enabled.  I also added a gimmick so
that the background of the JavaScript enabled field is pink
if JavaScript isn't present and green if it is.
</p>

<p>
Modified all Fourmilab links outside the JavaScrypt document
tree to include an explicit
&ldquo;<tt>http://www.fourmilab.ch/</tt>&rdquo;.  This permits
them to function even when the pages are accessed from a local
copy via a <tt>file:</tt> URL.
</p>

<p>
The welcome page, <tt>index.html</tt>, was needlessly including
several JavaScript modules it never actually used.  I removed
the script includes for them.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 27</h3>

<p>
Modified the <tt>nextInt</tt> methods in <tt>aesprng.js</tt>
and <tt>lecuyer.js</tt> to avoid the bias which results from
using a modulus to obtain a pseudorandom value with a range
which isn't a power of two.  As explained in section 10.8 of
Ferguson and Schneier's
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471223573/?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    rel="Target:Amazon_Fourmilab">Practical Cryptography</a></cite>,
to avoid a bias toward smaller values, one must generate
pseudorandom values between 0 and the next higher power of two
minus one, then discard results which are out of range in order
to preserve a uniform distribution within the requested range.
In <tt>aesprng.js</tt>, this fix has two additional salutary
effects.  First of all, it reduces the number of raw bytes
generated to the minimum required to produce the desired
result range and, if the requested range is 0&ndash;255, produces
identical results to those obtained by calling the
<tt>next()</tt> method directly.
</p>

<h3>2003 November 29</h3>

<p>
As reported by Steven Wittens, <tt>jscrypt.js</tt> failed to handle
plaintexts which contained Unicode characters greater than 0xFF.  The
conversion of the plaintext string to the AES plaintext byte array
simply truncated characters to 8 bits.  I added a new <tt>utf-8.js</tt>
module which handles transformation between Unicode strings and
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt"
    rel="Target:JavascryptAux">UTF-8</a>
encoded byte streams.  Canonical transformation is implemented in
the functions <tt>unicode_to_utf8</tt> and <tt>utf8_to_unicode</tt>,
which take a string argument and return the encoded or decoded string.
</p>

<p>
For use with JavaScrypt, the wrapper functions
<tt>encode_utf8</tt> and <tt>decode_utf8</tt> are used to
provide more efficient representation of the very common case of
text which consists only of ASCII and Latin-1 characters.  If
its argument contains neither any characters with code points
greater than or equal to 0xFF nor the character 0x9D (Unicode
OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND), <tt>encode_utf8</tt> is an identity
transformation&mdash;the encoded string is identical to the
input. Otherwise, <tt>encode_utf8</tt> returns a string which
begins with the character 0x9D acting as a sentinel, followed by
the UTF-8 encoding of the argument string.  The
<tt>decode_utf8</tt> function checks for the presence of the
0x9D sentinel and decodes the balance of the argument string as
UTF-8 or returns the argument unchanged accordingly.  Now, it
might have been more logical to use one of the two Unicode
PRIVATE USE control characters as the sentinels, but both of
them are overloaded by characters in the regrettable
&ldquo;Windows-1252&rdquo; character set.  Characters from that
set have no business appearing in JavaScript strings, but you
never know what somebody is going to paste into an HTML text
box, so this choice keeps such text from being unnecessarily
expanded to UTF-8.
</p>

<p>
Both <tt>jscrypt.js</tt> and <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> now apply
<tt>encode_utf8</tt> to text keys and seeds.  This avoids the
loss of information in upper bytes of characters greater than
0x7F.  Since <tt>encode_utf8</tt> is an identity for strings without
such characters, this change is upward compatible with any key or
seed consisting entirely of ASCII and Latin-1 graphic characters.
</p>

<p>
Added this development log to the Web directory, and provided a link
from the main page.
</p>

<h3>2004 March 19</h3>

<p>
The &ldquo;lean&rdquo; version, <tt>jscrypt.html</tt> failed to
embed the JavaScript code for <tt>utf-8.js</tt> because the
program which does the embedding assumed file names consisted
only of alphanumeric characters and failed to recognise the
external script reference to that file.  I modified the
embedding program accordingly and rebuilt <tt>jscrypt.html</tt>
with it.  Earlier testing failed to reveal this problem which
only manifested itself when the lean version was copied to a
directory which did not contain <tt>utf-8.js</tt>.
</p>

<h3>2005 December 16</h3>

<p>
The <tt>formatPlaintext</tt> function in <tt>aes.js</tt> uses a
heuristic instead of <tt>instanceof</tt> to decide whether its
argument is a string (primitive or reference) or an array of bytes
(numbers) in order to remain compatible with versions of Internet
Explorer prior to 5.0 which did not implement <tt>instanceof</tt>.
Unfortunately, this trick ran afoul of changes to the JavaScript
implementation in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.  After a bit of
experimentation, I made the test even more tricky and complicated and
it now seems to work on Firefox 1.5 as well as Firefox 1.0, Mozilla,
Opera, Internet Explorer (although I have nothing older than 6.0) and
Netscape 4.7 on SGI.
</p>

<p>
The link for verifying the distribution signing key on KeyServer
was broken due to a change in their domain name; fixed.
</p>

<p>
Added <tt>content-type</tt> declarations of <tt>charset=iso-8859-1</tt>
to all HTML documents and fixed most validation errors reported
by the W3C HTML validator for 4.01 Transitional.  A few remain,
however, so we're not claiming full compliance.  The problem
is that without the <tt>wrap="off"</tt> attribute in a number of
<tt>textarea</tt> fields, undesired line wrapping will occur.
You're supposed to be able to control this with the CSS
<tt>white-space:&nbsp;pre</tt> statement, but it doesn't seem
to do anything inside a <tt>textarea</tt>, even in Firefox 1.5.
So, there's no option but to leave the <tt>wrap</tt> in place,
even though the validator complains about it.
</p>

<p>
The HTML 4.01 compatibility fixes broke the Perl program which
creates the &ldquo;lean&rdquo; version of the
encryption/decryption page; fixed.
</p>

<h3>2005 December 24</h3>

<p>
Upgraded the following files for XHTML 1.0 syntax and validated
them for compliance:
<tt>aesprng_test.html</tt>,
<tt>distribution.html</tt>,
<tt>example.html</tt>,
<tt>index.html</tt>,
and <tt>log.html</tt>.
</p>

<h3>2005 December 25</h3>

<p>
Upgraded the following files for XHTML 1.0 syntax and validated
them for compliance:
<tt>javascrypt.html</tt>,
<tt>pass_phrase.html</tt>,
and <tt>stego.html</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Removed <tt>wrap="off"</tt> attributes in
<tt>&lt;textarea&gt;</tt> fields, as this is not an XHTML 1.0
(or HTML 4.01) supported mode.  The CSS mode which is supposed to
provide an equivalent doesn't work in current browsers, but
in any case this is purely an aesthetic and presentation issue:
wrapping of text within a <tt>textarea</tt> does not affect
its processing.
</p>

<p>
Modified the <tt>flense.pl</tt> Perl program used to build the
<tt>jscrypt.html</tt> &ldquo;lean&rdquo; version of the
encryption/decryption utility use XHTML
&ldquo;<tt>CDATA</tt>&rdquo; quoting of embedded JavaScript code
to avoid validation errors.  The XHTML quoting is commented out
with JavaScript comments to avoid problems with older browsers.
</p>

<h3>2018 March 12</h3>

<p>
Deleted the <tt>javascrypt.zip.sig</tt> distribution signature
file and references to it in the documents.  These signatures
and the PGP/GPG keys used to sign and verify them are a
perpetual source of fragility due to changing fashions in
cryptography.  It's better to do without than have to constantly
fix them.
</p>

<p>
Converted all HTML and JavaScript files in the distribution to
Fourmilab's source code standard of all spaces for white space
(no tabs), Unix end of line (LF) convention, and all white space
at the ends of lines trimmed.  In the Age of Extravagant
Computing the space savings from using tabs is incommensurate
with the trouble they create with text editors that can't agree
on where the tab stops are.
</p>

<p>
Updated all HTML files to use Unicode typography for quotes,
dashes, ellipses, etc.
</p>

<p>
Verified all links to books on Amazon, updated those for
which there are new editions, and converted all to the
current associate link format.
</p>

<p>
Created new CSS style sheet, <tt>javascrypt.css</tt>, and used
it in all the main HTML documents, in most cases completely
replacing their embedded CSS.  This is a much-simplified version
of the standard Fourmilab style sheet, stripped to contain only
what we need and to maintain our goal of operating without
references to any external Web resources.
</p>

<p>
Added &ldquo;<tt>use strict</tt>&rdquo; to all JavaScript files
and fixed the resulting quibbles.  These were mostly attempts to
delete variables pointing to objects (you should assign
<tt>null</tt> to them instead) and failing to declare iteration
variables in loops in third-party code incorporated in the
program.
</p>

<p>
Added <tt>&lt;label&gt;</tt> containers around check and radio
boxes so that their labels, and not just the box controls, can
be clicked.
</p>

<p>
Deleted a bunch of commented-out debug code which has been
present for more than a decade.  It is unlikely in the extreme
that at this remove we'll need it.
</p>

<h3>2018 March 13</h3>

<p>
Copied over the build tools from the original development
directory including the <tt>Makefile</tt>, JavaScript compression
utility, and the <tt>TOOLS</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
Re-crunched all of the production JavaScript files into .jsC
files with <tt>jcrunch.html</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Did a test re-build of <tt>jscrypt.html</tt>: the &ldquo;lean&rdquo;
version of the encryption/decryption utility with everything embedded.
At first glance, it looks OK, but we need to check out external CSS,
etc. references.  Indeed, we need to embed the stylesheet, which is
presently included.
</p>

<p>
Used the CSS compressor at <tt>https://csscompressor.com/</tt>
to compress <tt>javascrypt.css</tt> into
<tt>javascrypt.cssC</tt>, using the &ldquo;High&rdquo; setting,
which squashes white space but preserves line breaks.
</p>

<p>
Added code to <tt>TOOLS/flense.pl</tt> to interpolate CSS in the
HTML it is compressing.  It replaces CSS included with a
<tt>link</tt> tag with the corresponding <tt>.cssC</tt>
compressed file.
</p>

<p>
Updated the <tt>TOOLS/flense.pl</tt> program to &ldquo;<tt>use
strict</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>use warnings</tt>&rdquo; modes
and fixed problems those settings detected.
</p>

<p>
Moved the <tt>jcrunch.html</tt> utility to the TOOLS directory
and updated the <tt>Makefile</tt> to reference it there.
</p>

<p>
Installed the <tt>externalLinks.js</tt> utility to permit
opening external links in a specified tab/window in XHTML 1.0
Strict documents.  Made the corresponding <tt>.jsC</tt> file to
embed in the lean version.  Added to the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Converted all of the HTML files to XHTML 1.0 Strict.  This
involved a number of changes which affected the JavaScript,
both embedded and in separate files.  In particular, you
can't use a &ldquo;<tt>name=</tt>&rdquo; in a form to
access its content via DOM&mdash;instead it's necessary to
explicitly <tt>getElementById()</tt> from its <tt>id=</tt>.
</p>

<h3>2018 March 14</h3>

<p>
Fixed unbalanced <tt>FULL</tt> comments in
<tt>javascrypt.html</tt> used to create the &ldquo;lean&rdquo;
version.
</p>

<p>
Updated <tt>javascrypt.cssC</tt> to incorporate additions to
its parent uncompressed file.
</p>

<p>
Added a new <tt>webdist</tt> target to the <tt>Makefile</tt>
to create a distribution to install on the Web site.  Note
that the distribution now includes <tt>aesprng_test.html</tt>,
which we previously only included in the Zipped archive.
</p>

<p>
Cleaned up and added documentation to the <tt>Makefile</tt>,
in particular explaining the distinction between JavaScript
programs which are embedded in <tt>jscrypt.html</tt> and
must be maintained in compressed versions and those which
are used elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Added the option of generating signatures for pass phrases
generated by <tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> using any of the
MD5, SHA-224, or SHA-256 algorithms, selected from a
drop-down list.  The SHA-2 hashes are generated using a
new <tt>sha256.js</tt> file developed by Chen, Yi-Cyuan,
and released under the MIT License, which is included in
the file.  The master distribution for this package is
at <a href="https://github.com/emn178/js-sha256"
    rel="Target:JavascryptAux">https://github.com/emn178/js-sha256</a>.
</p>

<p>
Added real-time updating of the word count in
<tt>pass_phrase.html</tt> when the requested bit count is
changed (before, it only updated when you pressed
&ldquo;Generate&rdquo;), and to display the bit count rounded-up
based on the number of words which provide at least the
requested bit count.
</p>

<p>
Validated all HTML files.
</p>

<h3>2018 March 25</h3>

<p>
There was a typo in the declaration of variables at the top of
<tt>utf8_to_unicode()</tt> in <tt>utf-8.js</tt>.  The variable
&ldquo;<tt>b2</tt>&rdquo; was declared twice, where the intent
was to declare &ldquo;<tt>b2</tt>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<tt>b3</tt>&rdquo;.  This has been broken for more than a
decade, but didn't cause any problems until I set &ldquo;<tt>use
strict</tt>&rdquo; mode in the 2018-03-14 release.  In strict
mode, an undeclared variable is an error, and so decoding any
encrypted text containing a three byte UTF-8 code would fail.
As it happens, I never tried such text while testing the
program.  The fix is simple, although users may have to flush
their browser cache to cause <tt>utf-8.js</tt> to be reloaded.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>utf-8.js</tt> file is included in compressed form in the
<tt>jscrypt.html</tt> &ldquo;lean&rdquo; version of the
encryption page.  I remade <tt>utf-8.jsC</tt> and then rebuilt
the lean version incorporating the fix.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Loic Prot for reporting this problem and identifiying
the error in the code which caused it.
</p>

<p>
When <tt>jscrypt.html</tt> was produced from
<tt>javascrypt.html</tt>, the expansion of the inclusion of our
CSS file caused the specification of the character type to move
out of the first 1024 bytes of the file, which could cause some
browsers to not know how to interpret the file.  I moved the
<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt> declaration of the character type to right
after the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> tag, in keeping with Fourmilab
standards.  Although it's not strictly necessary, I also
similarly fixed all of the other HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Changed absolute references to the &ldquo;Valid XHTML 1.0&rdquo;
icon to <tt>https:</tt> to avoid mixed content natters when
securely viewing from the main site.
</p>

<h3>2018 May 25</h3>

<p>
The pass phrase generator (<tt>pass_phrase.html</tt>) would
refuse to generate pass phrases of one or two words because a
test in <tt>bitsWord()</tt> required the bit equivalent of the
number of words to be at least 32 and a second test in
<tt>GeneratePassPhrases()</tt> enforced a minimum of two words
per phrase.  I relaxed these tests to 14 bits and one word; the
code works fine with these values, and if that's what the user
wants, there's no reason to deny  their preference.
