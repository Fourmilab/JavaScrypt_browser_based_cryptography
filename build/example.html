<h1>JavaScrypt Tutorial</h1>

<hr class="h" />

<p>
I hear you.  <em>What do I do with all this stuff?</em>
Encryption is simple in concept (only the good guys can read
your message), but devilish in the details.  Here's a simple set
of worked examples which illustrate some of the ways you can use
JavaScrypt to protect your privacy. These examples open an
auxiliary browser window in which various JavaScrypt components
are demonstrated.  Please use the buttons in <em>this page</em>
exclusively; pressing the buttons in the popped-up window may
confuse the sequencing of the example.
</p>

<p>
Crypto-folk usually couch their examples in terms of messages
sent between the virtuous &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bob&rdquo;, who wish to avoid them being intercepted and
read by the nefarious &ldquo;Eve&rdquo;.  I'll follow that
convention here, so let's join Alice and Bob as they hatch a
plot.
</p>

<form id="key" action="#" onsubmit="return false;">

<h2><a name="Encrypt">Encrypt a Message</a></h2>

<p>
We'll begin by encrypting a short message from Alice
at headquarters to Bob in the field.  First, Alice loads the
JavaScrypt page into her browser.  Press the button below to
launch JavaScrypt in a new window or tab.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="e1" value="  Launch JavaScrypt  "
    onclick="launchButton(); keyForm.e1.disabled = true; keyForm.e2.disabled=false;" />
</p>

<p>
Alice and Bob have decided to use a &ldquo;book code&rdquo; for
their encryption keys.  When they last met face to face, they
agreed to obtain the keys for their encrypted messages from an
innocuous science fiction novel,
<a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/about/"
    rel="Target:JavascryptAux">Rudy Rucker</a>'s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568582471/?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    rel="Target:Amazon_Fourmilab"><cite>The Hacker and the
Ants</cite></a>.  Each time Alice or Bob sends a message, they
pick a page of the book and line number on the page at random,
then use whatever text appears on that line as the encryption
key. The line, once used, is crossed out (sorry, Rudy!) so it
will never inadvertently be reused.  This way, no two messages
are ever sent with the same key, and each key, composed of an
entire line of English text, is sufficiently long as to be
difficult to guess.  (Book codes are far from optimal; later on
we'll discuss more secure alternatives. At the moment, we're
concerned with the mechanics of encryption and decryption, not
details of key generation and distribution.)
</p>

<p>
This time, by throwing dice or whatever, Alice has chosen line 28
on page 172 of the book, which reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;<cite>serious hacker you don't let flames bother you.
Instead</cite>&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the key for the message, so Alice types it into the
<b>Key</b> box on the JavaScrypt page.  Press the button below
to enter the key into the box.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="e2" value="     Set Encryption Key     "
    onclick="setKeyButton(); keyForm.e2.disabled = true; keyForm.e3.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Next, Alice enters the text of her message to Bob in the
<b>Plain Text</b> box.  &ldquo;Plain Text&rdquo; refers to the
original message before encryption into &ldquo;Cipher
Text&rdquo;, or recovered from the Cipher Text by decryption.
Press the button below to enter Alice's message into the
<b>Plain Text</b> box. &ldquo;BAGPIPE FJORD&rdquo; is the
meaningless code name for the operation she's giving Bob the
go-ahead to proceed with; later on we'll see how to generate
such names automatically.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="e3" value="     Paste Message into Plain Text Box     "
    onclick="pastePlainButton(); keyForm.e3.disabled = true; keyForm.e4.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
All that remains is to press the <b>Encrypt</b> button below the
Plain Text box.  Please press the button below (for tedious
technical reasons, <em>not</em> the one in the JavaScrypt page),
to encrypt the Plain Text with the key.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="e4" value="     Press Encrypt Button    "
    onclick="encryptButton(); keyForm.e4.disabled = true; keyForm.s1.disabled = keyForm.d1.disabled = keyForm.e1.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Alice can now copy the encrypted message from the <b>Cipher Text</b>
box (pressing the
<b><a href="javascript:if (sampleWindow) { swC('cipher').text.select();} ">Select</a></b>
button below it selects the entire cipher text) and paste it
into an E-mail message to Bob.  Before the cipher text, Alice
will write the page and line number she used as the key.  If Eve
intercepts the E-mail, this won't do her any good unless she's
somehow learned which book Alice and Bob are using for their
keys.
</p>

<h2><a name="Decrypt">Decrypt a Message</a></h2>

<p>
Now we change the scene from Alice's air conditioned office to
Bob's more austere accommodations in the field.  After receiving
Alice's message, including the page and line numbers at the
start, he loads a copy of JavaScrypt into his own browser, as
you can do by pressing the following button. If the button is
disabled, you need to go back and work the
<a href="#Encrypt">Encrypt a Message</a> example at the top of
this page to create a message to decrypt.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="d1" value="  Launch JavaScrypt  "
    onclick="launchButton(); keyForm.d1.disabled = true; keyForm.d2.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Bob begins by pasting Alice's message into the initially empty
<b>Cipher Text</b> box.  Note that the message contains Alice's
page and line notation, &ldquo;<tt>172/28</tt>&rdquo;.
JavaScrypt ignores any text before the start of the encrypted
message, so Bob hasn't bothered to remove the key annotation
from Alice's message.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="d2" value="     Paste Encrypted Message into Cipher Text Box     "
    onclick="pasteCipherButton(); keyForm.d2.disabled = true; keyForm.d3.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Bob then proceeds to dig out his copy of <cite>The Hacker and
the Ants</cite>, turns to page 172 and counts down 28 lines to
find the key, which he types into the <b>Key</b> box at the top
of the JavaScrypt page.  Press the button below to enter the
key.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="d3" value="     Set Decryption Key     "
    onclick="setKeyButton(); keyForm.d3.disabled = true; keyForm.d4.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Now Bob need only press the <b>Decrypt</b> button below the
<b>Cipher Text</b> box to decrypt the message.  Alice's original
text will now appear in the <b>Plain Text</b> box.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="d4" value="     Press Decrypt Button    "
    onclick="decryptButton(); keyForm.d4.disabled = true; keyForm.d1.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
To recover the Plain Text, the decryption key must be identical
to that used to encrypt the message. Try changing a single
character of the key in the JavaScrypt page and pressing the
<b>Decrypt</b> button below the <b>Cipher Text</b> box and see
what you get for Plain Text.
</p>

<h2>Hiding a Message as English Text</h2>

<p>
Suppose that instead of E-mailing the message to Bob, Alice is
forced to send it to the FAX machine in Bob's seedy hotel.
Sending what is obviously an encrypted message may cause hotel
personnel to suspect Bob isn't the mild-mannered motorcycle
parts salesman he purports to be, which information they might
be tempted to peddle to folks Bob would rather not be aware of
his actual profession.  But since few of the locals know much
English, Bob's receiving messages in English may not arouse
suspicion, even if the message reads like gibberish to an
English speaker.
</p>

<p>
In this situation, Alice might want to employ
<em>steganography</em>, the art of secret writing, to disguise
the nature of her message. Steganography is a large topic with
roots in antiquity, ranging from invisible ink to microdots to
the latest digital techniques of hiding messages as
imperceptible noise in image and audio files. JavaScrypt's
steganography is less sophisticated that the latter mechanisms,
but may be adequate for less demanding situations.  Having first
encrypted the message, Alice selects the Cipher Text and copies
it to the clipboard, then launches <em>Stego!</em>, JavaScrypt's
steganography page.  Press the button below to load this page.
If the button is disabled, you need to go back and work the
<a href="#Encrypt">Encrypt a Message</a> example at the top of
this page to obtain a message to hide.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="s1" value="  Launch Stego!  "
    onclick="launchStego(); keyForm.s1.disabled = true; keyForm.s2.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Alice then pastes the encrypted Cipher Text into the eponymous
box in the Stego! page, which you can accomplish by pressing the
button below.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="s2" value="     Paste Encrypted Message into Cipher Text Box     "
    onclick="pasteStegoCipherButton(); keyForm.s2.disabled = true; keyForm.s3.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Next, Alice presses the <b>Hide</b> button below the Cipher Text
she just pasted into the box to encode it as a sequence of
English words.  Press the button below to proceed with this
step.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="s3" value="     Press Hide Button    "
    onclick="hideButton(); keyForm.s3.disabled = true; keyForm.s1.disabled = keyForm.u1.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Alice may then send the text in which the encrypted message has
been hidden to Bob, adding to it an annotation which permits him
to determine the page and line of the book to use as the key to
decrypt it.
</p>

<h2>Recovering a Message Hidden in English Text</h2>

<p>
Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob gets it into his computer
(if it arrived as a FAX, he'll have to type it in, but he
needn't worry about the punctuation&mdash;only the words
matter).  He then launches Stego!, as you may do with the
following button.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="u1" value="  Launch Stego!  "
    onclick="launchStego(); keyForm.u1.disabled = true; keyForm.u2.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Bob then pastes the text in which the message is hidden into the
<b>Hidden Text</b> box.  Press the button below to accomplish
this.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="u2" value="     Paste Hidden Message into Hidden Text Box     "
    onclick="pasteStegoHiddenButton(); keyForm.u2.disabled = true; keyForm.u3.disabled=false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Finally, Bob presses the <b>Seek</b> button below the <b>Hidden
Text</b> box.  The encrypted message will be extracted and
placed into the <b>Cipher text</b> box, whence Bob can copy it
back to JavaScrypt to decode.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="u3" value="     Press Seek Button    "
    onclick="seekButton(); keyForm.u3.disabled = true; keyForm.d1.disabled = keyForm.u1.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
You may now, if you wish, return to the <a
href="#Decrypt">Decrypt a Message</a> example to verify the
recovered text actually contains Alice's original message.
</p>

<h2>Generating One-Time Key Lists</h2>

<p>
Using a book for encryption keys as Alice and Bob did in the
example above may be convenient, but has its disadvantages.  A
mole who observes Alice looking up keys, or a covert break-in at
Bob's hangout in the field looking for a well-thumbed book,
might permit Eve to determine which book Alice and Bob were
using, permitting her to read all of the traffic between them
without raising any suspicion on their part; this could be a
career-limiting situation, particularly for Bob.  Also, lines
from books are usually short and contain many frequently-used
words: in cryptographic lingo, their <em>entropy</em> is low,
and rarely takes advantage of all the security provided by the
underlying encryption scheme.
</p>

<p>
If Alice and Bob have the opportunity to meet occasionally or
can avail themselves of the services of a trusted courier, they
may prefer to use <em>one-time key lists</em> to encrypt their
messages. A one-time key list is simply a list of keys generated
by a high-quality random or pseudorandom process. Two copies of
the list are made: one for Alice and one for Bob.  Each time
Alice sends a message to Bob, she uses the next key on the list
and crosses it out.  Bob, upon receiving the message, enters the
next from his list and crosses it out.  No key is ever used
twice, and unless the physical lists used by Alice and Bob are
compromised, the keys will remain secure. (If messages may be
received out of order, they should be preceded by the number of
the key on the list; this doesn't impair security in any way.
Alice and Bob would actually use two pairs of lists, one for
sending messages from Alice to Bob, the other for messages from
Bob to Alice.)
</p>

<p>
JavaScrypt includes a <cite>Pass Phrase Generator</cite> which
assists in the preparation of one-time key lists.  Start by
launching the pass phrase generator in a browser window.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="p1" value="  Launch Pass Phrase Generator  "
    onclick="launchPassPhrase(); keyForm.p1.disabled = true; keyForm.p2.disabled = false;" />
</p>

<p>
The sequence of pass phrases generated is determined by a
&ldquo;seed&rdquo;, which can be specified either as text or a
hexadecimal number.  Knowledge of the seed permits anybody with
a copy of the pass phrase generator to reproduce the list of
phrases, so security of the seed is essential. The pass phrase
generator can automatically create pseudorandom seeds of
sufficient length to provide reasonable security.  Press the
button below to generate such a seed.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="p2" value="  Generate Seed  "
    onclick="passPhraseGenerateSeed(); keyForm.p2.disabled = true; keyForm.p3.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Once the seed has been specified, a list of pass phrases may be
generated simply by pressing the <b>Generate</b> button.  Press
the button below to create a list.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="p3" value="  Generate Pass Phrases  "
    onclick="passPhraseGeneratePhrases(); keyForm.p3.disabled = true; keyForm.p1.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
Once a list of phrases is generated, you can use the
<b>Select</b> button to select the text, then copy and paste it
into the key list document.  Note that once Alice and Bob have
received their initial key lists, they can obtain additional
secure keys without physically exchanging lists.  When her list
of keys is nearing exhaustion, Alice need only generate a new
list, then use one of her remaining keys to encrypt a message to
Bob containing the seed she used for the new key list.  Bob can
then enter the seed into his own copy of the pass phrase
generator page and produce an identical copy of Alice's new key
list. Alternatively, she could simply send the entire new list
to Bob in an encrypted message, but just sending the seed makes
for a shorter message.
</p>

<h2>Generating Operation Codenames</h2>

<p>
The pass phrase generator, suitably configured, is an excellent
source of codenames for covert operations.  These names
shouldn't have any meaning whatsoever relevant to the operation
(this is guaranteed, since the pass phrase generator cannot read
the minds of those plotting it). The process below will provide
you with an endless list of suggestions.  Repeat it as many
times as you need to find something with the right ring.  Start
by launching the pass phrase generator.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="o1" value="  Launch Pass Phrase Generator  "
    onclick="launchPassPhrase(); keyForm.o1.disabled = true; keyForm.o2.disabled = false;" />
</p>

<p>
As before, we wish to generate a pseudorandomly chosen set of
candidate codenanes, so we use the <b>Generate Seed</b> button
to create a new seed.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="o2" value="  Generate Seed  "
    onclick="passPhraseGenerateSeed(); keyForm.o2.disabled = true; keyForm.o3.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
With the seed specified, we can now proceed to generate a page
full of potential codenames.  We will fill in the boxes below
the list of phrases to produce traditional two-word codenames of
all capital letters.  Press the button below to fill the box
with candidate names.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="o3" value="  Generate Codenames  "
    onclick="codeNameGeneratePhrases(); keyForm.o3.disabled = true; keyForm.o4.disabled = keyForm.o1.disabled = false;"
    disabled="disabled" />
</p>

<p>
The best codenames come from a judicious combination of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0716704633/?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
    rel="Target:Amazon_Fourmilab">computer
power and human reason</a>.  As Winston Churchill observed,
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="quotation">
    After all, the world is wide, and intelligent thought will
    readily supply an unlimited number of well-sounding names
    which do not suggest the character of the operation or
    disparage it in any way and do not enable some widow or
    mother to say that her son was killed in an operation called
    &ldquo;Bunnyhug&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ballyhoo&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p class="citation">
    &mdash;Winston S. Churchill,
    <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/039541685X/?tag=fourmilabwwwfour"
        rel="Target:Amazon_Fourmilab">The Second World War</a>:</cite>

        rel="Target:Amazon_Fourmilab">Volume V: Closing the Ring</a></cite>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If none of the generated codenames makes the cut, scroll up to
the <b>Seed</b> box, press <b>New Seed</b> to generate another
seed, and then press <b>Generate</b> to grow another crop of
codenames&mdash;lather, rinse, repeat.  Or, just click the
button below to generate as many as it takes to find one that
suits.
</p>

<p class="c">
<input type="button" name="o4" value="  Generate More Codenames  "
    onclick="codeNameReGeneratePhrases();"
    disabled="disabled" />
